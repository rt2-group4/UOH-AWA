        <p>Accessibility is making sure people can access the content you create. For every product that you create, you need to make sure that people, disabled or not, can access it.</p>
        <p>Everyone should be ensured to have the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.</p>

        <h3 id="accessibility-context-heading">Context of Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Accessibility must be considered throughout design, development, content creation, and maintenance of digital assets. But accessibility is not only the right thing to do, <strong>it’s also the law.</strong> Under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 federal agencies must build websites and digital services that conform to the Revised 508 Standards.</p>
        <p>There are four areas of accessibility that need to be thought about when designing. These four areas are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Physical (motor disabilities)</li>
            <li>Cognitive</li>
            <li>Auditory (hearing disabilities)</li>
            <li>Visual</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, these assistive technologies alone are not enough to make the web accessible to users with disabilities. Here are three ways to improve accessibility:</p>

        <h4 id="wcag-heading">WCAG</h4>
        <p>In order have some kind of standard for accessibility, WCAG was created. WCAG stands for The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. It is a global collaboration on technical standards to make the web more accessible to all individuals everywhere.</p>
        <p>WCAG is based on four main guiding principles of accessibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perceivable</li>
            <li>Operable</li>
            <li>Understandable</li>
            <li>Robust</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following these principles, will mean that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Text is readable and understandable</li>
            <li>Content appears and operates in predictable ways</li>
            <li>Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes</li>
        </ul>
