        <h3 id="color-contrast-heading">Color Contrast</h3>
        <p>Text and interactive elements should have a high contrast ratio against their background to ensure readability for users with low vision or color blindness. Some of them include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For normal text, a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 is recommended</li>
            <li>For large text (18pt or larger), a ratio of 3:1 is acceptable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tools like the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker can help assess and adjust contrast levels.</p>

            <li>icons</li>
            <li>shapes </li>
        </ul>
        <p> For example, a red warning message should also include a symbol like an exclamation mark or the word "Warning" in text.</p>
